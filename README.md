# speech_to_text

I have used Web Speech API (a very powerful browser user-interface that allows you to record human speech into text).
I have used jQuery for easier DOM (document object model) operations (A DOM is acts as an interface between application program and
XHTML or HTML or XML document.) and Shoelace.css (It is a light-weight, forward-thinking CSS library built with future CSS syntax).

The Web Speech API has two independent interfaces:
1. SpeechRecognition (Speech->Text)
2. SpeechSynthesis (Text->Speech)

SpeechRecognition is used here.
